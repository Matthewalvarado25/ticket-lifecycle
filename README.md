<p>
  
 The intake is the beginning of the osticket lifecycle. This is the osTicket support page where users go to create tickets

</p>
<p>
  
We will be creating tickets as end users , for this example I will be a user named Karen who needs assistance and created a ticket. The help topic is business critical outage and the entire mobile banking system is down.

<h3> Assignment and Communication </h3>

<p>
Now that the ticket has been created. I log in as support agent John Doe's account and check to see if any tickets are open to be worked on.

As the support agent John Doe you will determine the severity of the situation by reading the ticket.
If the ticket is unclear of what the problem is the agent will email the user to gather further details on the issue.
The support agent will update the ticket to SLA (Sev-A, Sev-B, Sev-C), update help topic, assign to team and assign the ticket to himself, another agent, or to another department to have the issue resolved.
  
</p>
<p>

When the ticket was opened support agent John updated the SLA plan to SEV-A to measure the severity of the problem

Agent John next updated the Help topic

Agent John will assign the ticket to the online banking team, since he does not have access to the online banking department. We will log in as Agent Jane Doe who is a member of the online banking team and work on the ticket. 

</p>
<br />


</p>
<p>

Instead of having the ticket assigned to the online banking team, Agent Jane will assign it to herself.


<h3> Working the issue </h3>

<p>
While working the issue, support agent Jane should constantly be updating the ticket thread with troubleshooting that has been done, and any new information that has been obtained

<h3> Resolution </h3>

<p>
  
At this point, the issue has been addressed and a solution has been confirmed. The support agent Jane Doe will now confirm with the user that the issue has been resolved after applying the solution. Once confirmed that the solution works, agent Jane Doe will now document any details that have not already been noted, then set the ticket status to "Closed".
