</p>
<p>
  
We will be creating tickets as end users , for this example I will be a user named Karen who needs assistance and created a SEV-A ticket where the help topic is business critical outage and the entire mobile banking system is down.

</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
  
I also created a second ticket as a user named Ken who also needs assistance. The help topic is general inquiry/other and accounting department needs help accessing adobe reader. (You will see at times users might not give the best clarification on an issue based on the example below).

</p>
<br />

<h3>Step:2 Assignment and Communication </h3>

<p>
Now that the ticket has been created. I log in as support agent John Doe's account and check to see if any tickets are open to be worked on.

As the support agent John Doe you will determine the severity of the situation by reading the ticket.
If the ticket is unclear of what the problem is the agent will email the user to gather further details on the issue.
The support agent will update the ticket to SLA (Sev-A, Sev-B, Sev-C) and assign the ticket to himself, another agent, or to another department to have the issue resolved.
